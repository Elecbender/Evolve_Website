Users can submit and discuss technological ideas on how to improve humanity
NOTE: This project is on hold.

1)  Users (using an authorization code stored in a database) will have the opportunity to create their login.
2)  Upon doing so, there will be categories such as neuroscience, biological, space, etc.  Each category will have their respective forum
    and users can chat respectively.
3)  These ideas can then be submitted to companies such as NASA to perhaps give these ideas some consideration.
